Now let me discuss our outlook for the second quarter of FY '21. The despite the geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns associated with COVID-19, we believe the underlying secular demand for our key growth platforms remain solid. Based on our strong Q1 bookings, and much higher backlog entering the quarter and our record POS in Q1. We are currently estimating Q2 net revenues to be between $138 million and $146 million. To attain the midpoint of our guidance range or approximately $142 million, we needed net turns orders of approximately 20% at the beginning of Q2. Our guidance assumes no more shipments to Huawei this quarter and also takes into consideration the additional entity list restrictions put in place recently by the federal government. We expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be between $0.40 and $0.44 per diluted share. I will now hand the call back to the operator, and Sandy and Emeka and I will be happy to answer any questions.

I'd like to spend a few moments discussing Wesco's sales, what we're seeing in the market and how we're continuing to grow our business globally. Revenue growth continued strong Q2, with the growth consisting of a diversified mix of new customers, increased SKUs within our existing customer base, robust growth internationally and continued success within our electronic products business. As Randy mentioned, we continue to gain market share, which we expect will lead to new product penetration and increased opportunities as the market upturn gains traction. As we mentioned earlier this year, we believe that a governmental budget issues could lead to an increasing need for military customers to reduce cost through outsourcing of both products and services. This has proven to be true as our share of both parts and services within our existing military customers continues to grow."

As you probably know, revenues were up over $100 million or 16%, as Glen mentioned, due in large part to the yield performance. So despite lapping some pretty challenging comps year-over-year, we're seeing yield performance continue to hold strong.

On the other hand, there is still a high level of complexity with the additional costs in the areas of procurement, production and logistics. This environment will continue for the foreseeable future. Our teams work tirelessly on solutions to meet market demand, and we work closely with our customers every day to provide the best possible support for their network expansion. Nevertheless, the industry continues to solve the challenges arising from the global shortage of semiconductors.

Adjusted diluted EPS grew by 1%, aided by a 2% reduction in diluted share count from the prior-year period as a result of our share repurchase programs. In the second quarter, issuance activity was mixed. Falling benchmark rates, tighter spreads and the economic fundamentals supported strong issuance conditions. However, declining global growth forecast, continued geopolitical uncertainty and lower M&A and investment activity kept some issuers on the sidelines. A resurgence in corporate fixed rate issuance helped partially offset weakness in floating rate bank loans. Overall, however, global issuance activity fell for the fourth consecutive quarter.

They can buy sovereign debt with a 0 risk weight, and it got the cash to do it by pledging almost anything on their balance sheet. And so that in and out of itself will help to a small extent, the banks repair their capital ratios. But a lot of the financial institutions in Europe, in particular, are going to need more than that. And so they're going to be a quite a number of institutions that go insolvent and have to get dealt with. And so that will create lots of opportunities for us as institutions rationalize their size, their expense base and a number go out of business. So the governments will be, I think, having enough potential fundraising power to heal a lot of what's going on in Europe and U.S., but there is still going to be a great number of assets that fall out as opportunities for us.

Increasing oil prices are what we have to monitor closely. Its additive impact on domestic inflation trends need to be watched out for. Liquidity, again, is likely to continue being tight, whether driven by policy or by market pressures. And hence, as indicated by our Governor recently, this will keep pressure on interest rates. Fortunately, the credit cycle still looks acceptable. However, continuing inflation and elevated interest rates will ultimately create uncomfortable outcomes. Net-net, for some time into the near future, I expect the growth to NIM trade-off to be better bet as compared to the growth to credit trade-off and probably that's what we will be following."

In addition, we benefited from positive geographic mix as markets where shipments lagged reported unit cases were in revenue for CSC markets. As we move through the year, I would like to remind you a couple of points: First, we move again to cycle better underlying pricing; and second, as we catch up from the timing of shipments in international markets, we will see negative pressure in the geographic mix in the consolidated level. Therefore, while we remain resolutely focused on driving revenue in our market, we do expect price/mix to moderate from the current level."

We will be able to finish the 40 stores that we mentioned that we'll build. We'll be able to finish those, I think, because those approvals are largely done. And so I do expect that CapEx will move at a much faster clip going forward, not necessarily -- sure we're going to get to where we've been in the prior years because the same issue around new sites in certain geographies will still apply. And so if we have been building 50 or 60 stores in the past, at a certain level of capital, we won't get to that same level realistically. But I do think the other thing to keep in mind, right, we're building our third distribution center currently in Missouri. And most of that spend with the entire project is a little over $63 million. Most of that spend should happen this fiscal year based on the current time line. So all in all, there probably won't be a significant difference from a total capital spending standpoint on a year-over-year basis. But if we miss, we'll probably miss a little bit on the lighter side than heavier just because of the starting point."

In the quarter, Western Europe declined by 11% and demand in Eastern Europe by 19%. The market demand continues to also be at lower levels than before the pandemic, declining by 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Consumer confidence remained low with consumer demand being negatively impacted by the high general inflation, increased interest rates and geopolitical tensions. The decline in consumer demand was amplified by retailer inventory reductions, subsequent high levels entering the quarter, also outside the white goods category. For white goods, retailer inventory levels now seem to be normalized, while other categories such as electronics are estimated to remain high. With the lower consumer purchasing power, there are signs of consumers mixing down. This is mostly seen in the lower price points, leading to increased polarization in the market."

That said, it's fair to say that there's been little interest in gold over the last couple of years as other assets and property values and stock markets have gone up materially globally. And we do see in the last few months, an increasing interest in gold from people who previously may not have shown a lot of interest and there is definitely a reemergence of interest in the gold space, and whether that's because of inflation fears starting to come back, whether it's because of geopolitical concerns, gold as a safe haven is starting to be looked at again as an inflation hedge. So I'm optimistic about the gold price, but certainly not planning the future of our business on a higher gold price."

So solid growth and by solid, I think one of the elements has to do with how balanced growth was. We've registered growth, both in customer resources, also in loans and advances to customers. So credit has been growing. Customer resources have been growing as well. And that has been a reality not only in Portugal, but also in our international activity. So there's this element of balance that is rather satisfactory to us in this first quarter as the market has been volatile and as realities across the different geographies where we operate has been pretty different.

There's a lot of global uncertainty, there's a lot of political uncertainty. But based on the leasing environment we see today, I do think we'll get above 94% by the first half of next year, and from there, obviously, that helps with the less capacity, the less availability. And the more capacity we have, the more availability we have, it makes it tougher on leasing spreads. So, as that diminishes when we get back to pre-pandemic levels as we're approaching right now, it really gives us more leverage on negotiating the rents for that remaining space. So, we were double-digit growth in the second quarter, we were double-digit re-leasing spreads in the third quarter and we're cautiously optimistic that's going to continue."

After the revenue decrease was attributable to our decision to cease separation from certain countries. Our revenue performance also reflected lower Industrial maintenance services in Europe and continued softness in certain commercial construction markets. These negative factors were partially offset by improved equipment rental activity in certain geographies, such as North America and the Middle East. Foreign currency translation reduced revenue an additional $2 million in the quarter. As expected, Infrastructure improved its operating results reporting an operating loss of $12 million compared with an adjusted loss of $18 million in the prior year quarter. This improvement primarily reflected improved rental equipment activity, the benefit from our prior cost reduction actions and positive impact of exiting certain countries in 2012."

Masimo Technologies were the subject of 18 clinical studies, many of them highlighting the positive clinical outcomes and patient safety impact of total hemoglobin, PBI, acoustic respiration rate and SEDLine great function monitoring. In addition, more than 200 clinicians attended the symposium to hear leading anesthesiologists discuss their experience with SpHb PBI ramp and Patient SafetyNet and thousands of ASA attendees checked the Masimo exhibit to see a host of new breakthrough products. For example, we announced, during ASA, that our rainbow platform is expanding once again with the addition of fractional arterial measurement will be delivered through the new rainbow super sensor. Previously, Pulse Oximeters could only measure and display functional oxygen saturation or SpO2. So if patient has elevated carboxyhemoglobin and/or elevated methemoglobin, the display functional oxygen saturation overestimate the actual oxygen saturation value. Masimo's new fractional arterial oxygen saturation measurement or SpFO2 will be, for the first time non-invasively measured oxygenation in the presence of this hemoglobin. To illustrate the importance of this, consider this example, in a patient who has an SpO2 of 98%, carboxyhemoglobin level of 12% and methemoglobin level of 1%, SpFO2 will be displaying at 85%. It's highly likely that clinicians treating this patient would frequently make different diagnostic and therapeutic decisions at an oxygenation of 85% versus 98%, which is what SpO2 will display. Both SpFO2 and the rainbow universal super sensor are pending FDA clearance but are available in our country."

And -- but also doing security in the networking environment not need a huge company in power, which has come from ASIC investment we made, which also will take a long time to see the return of investment, that's what we kind of comment from day 1 back, years ago. So when we start with we really need to invest and planning all these kind of long-term convergence of networking or security together. So the new EC is 1 example is the fifth generation of SoC chip, which also including some of the investments we made in the mine generation of our content process and seven-generation networks together with a lot of multiple CPU. So we continue to develop technology and eventually will be deployed more broadly beyond the traditional network security. ."

At the same time, we have some negative impact of foreign currencies in backlog of around $10 million. So I would say that all in all, the backlog increase does reflect the good business momentum we see all around. And another, I think, to note is we've seen both the backlog and pipeline diversify more and more, both geographically and the additional of new customers such as Globe that was mentioned early before in the Philippines and other customers. So again, specifically this quarter, Globe has just announced awarding the deal to us. It is not signed, and it's not yet in the backlog, but just giving it as an example of the kind of diversity we're seeing now going into the backlog numbers as well."

So it's not based solely on the pandemic, obviously. That would be too optimistic. So the things that are really out of control, our study start up and site activation activities, and they're going quite well. And so, we anticipate being fully ready for the flu season. the things that's not under our control is the incidents in geographical spread and nature of the flu. So we'll have to see what that does."

And so we're very, very committed to with each floor sets trying to create a very differentiated story to tell. That's the first one. Second is we have a number of interesting product launches coming up as we go through the year, which obviously, we figure out how to market and how to promote in order to drive traffic. And then, thirdly, we are constantly testing different promotional vehicles, different ways of communicating that in different price points. And in some cases, we've been able to price up as we've gone through, which is up from the margin expansion side. But between those 3 things, those are the things we'll be focused on this year in order to combat any potential traffic challenges."
