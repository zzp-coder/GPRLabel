We are under the assumption that demand for our commercial OEM products will continue to be significantly reduced during fiscal 2021 due to reductions in OEM production rates and airlines deferring or canceling new aircraft orders. Longer term, the impact of COVID-19 is fluid and continues to evolve, but we anticipate significant negative impacts on our commercial OEM end market for some uncertain period of time. On a positive note, it is encouraging that the MAX is moving closer to recertification in several countries, although the near-term impact to our business will likely be minimal given the low build rates."

So we are quite cautious in giving the direction for the future. And what we -- you have to be aware about one thing you have in Romania, the obligation of contracting motor TPL. So also this makes business a bit different than maybe in some of the other countries. And you -- we see still some volatile political landscape, which could also have certain influences on our insurance business in Romania. So as it looks like it goes into the right direction, nevertheless, I think for a market like Romania, cautiousness is the right attitude."

Strong macroeconomic growth reported for the second quarter, together with healthier employment conditions for the current quarter suggested accelerating U.S. growth. Concurrent with stronger growth, we would expect equity markets to perform well and interest rates to climb. However, significant geopolitical uncertainty, plus perceived weakness in the major European and Chinese economies had a dampening effect on equity markets.  In addition, these factors helped to reinforce the U.S. status as a safe haven for international investors, which place downward pressure on interest rates. The equity markets demonstrated a balancing act in the context of conflicting influences. Broad indices were essentially flat for the quarter, while small cap stocks experienced a 5% to 10% decline in value.  These conditions adversely impacted capital raising during the quarter, particularly in smaller growth oriented stocks. With valuations at relatively attractive levels and generally low volatility, M&A activity was healthy."

And obviously getting that signal from all the noise when something is going not according to plan, when you might have a security incident, or you might have a breach, or you might have some behavior from an IP range or a geography that you wouldn't expect, you can do something about that in real time and we'll alert you to that."

A company with a broad clinical and late preclinical stage pipeline, using multiple modalities to treat and potentially cure serious diseases outside of CF. A company with current and future top and bottom line growth and a strong balance sheet.

There is greater demand for quality control testing. We have and will continue to meet that need through either our older testing process or the PTS, whichever suits the clients step. I'd like to take moment to talk about the situation in Japan. Charles River has been working to support its employees and clients in Japan and our thoughts are with the people of that nation during this difficult time. We are fortunate that all of our employees in Japan are safe and that our 5 facilities are fully operational. We are working with our Japanese colleagues and clients to continuously monitor and evaluate the situation. We have experienced some moderate disruption in our Japanese operation, as the country and our clients respond to the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami. Tom will give you some additional details shortly but from an EPS perspective, our current view is that the first quarter outperformance will likely cover our estimated exposure to Japan."

Could you provide a little more color on kind of why that's the case? And is that something that we should expect to continue or do you think as the geographic expansion kind of progresses, that the margins will kind of trend back up to a little but more normalized levels?"

And then finally, the thing that has been encouraging for us is, when we're out there selling fiber and people think I'm okay, we're focused on selling symmetrical HSIA, like we are. Uplink speeds better equivalent to the downlink speeds. We're up there selling our TV solution prospectively, SmartHome security and the like."

    "text": "See the air cooler business has been doing well. You're right, in the last couple of years, unfortunately, we have had the COVID impact because COVID hit in the peak of the selling season for air coolers. Air coolers was a [indiscernible] high [indiscernible] business. If I look at the current period, which is starting from March, we have seen good traction. Of course, it's got to do with a very hot summer that has been going on across the country. Although there has been some impact also on commodities in air coolers. But I would say air coolers growth is up to our expectation. That's one."

As I just mentioned, the war in Ukraine presented additional challenges, putting further upward pressure on energy prices and inflation. It also caused temporary reductions in vehicle production in Europe, which consequentially exacerbated volume headwinds in the region. Altogether, this impact drove a reduction in consolidated EBITDA on a year-over-year basis."

The new government assumes the task will not negate in the country through the crisis in the next few months and then call general elections in all likelihood towards the end of the first quarter of 2012."

We would like to see that the speed at which we received new orders in April and May is very good, very good. And this is the result of difficulties that our competitors are having. And this is -- we have reorganized our sales area. So we're celebrating very cautiously. We went through a difficult period. But we have a healthy portfolio, very healthy portfolio of orders. And we are working on this. In terms of the exchange rates, normally, this interval is not such a radical change. To change the appetite for a country to buy or not to buy. Traditionally, a change in the exchange rate will not affect the sales in many countries, like in Africa, for example. So in reality, we're looking at Argentina. For the time being, we're looking at the local behavior, the volume between Auto Parts and implements. We have 8% to 10% of our flow of sales in Argentina. And we don't believe this will change. Now concerning other countries, China, Peru, these locations. There are now change in plans. So we look at -- we already mentioned here, the exchange rate. No radical changes in our expectations due to the exchange rate."
