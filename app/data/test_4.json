First is we still haven't filled in full impact of the political deposit runoff in terms of average balances impacting our NIM. So if you think about when the political runoff happened, it happened in November and then continued little bit after that as well. So there will probably be $70 million to $100 million of noninterest bearing pressure on the average balances in Q1, that will have a downward impact on NIM. Secondly, the rest of it is just a really a function of our forecasting in terms of a lower rate environment. We probably forecasted we use the January interest rate environment, obviously the long-term rates have come down then it's just the addition of the various loan balances coming in and runoff of the indirect portfolio as well."

It's not a high-level attempt to assess particular potential market size but rather clear and defined opportunity for which we are in the process of putting together a proposal. Out of EUR 99 billion identified increasing 13% from the figure at year-end, the projects identified fall within our areas of deep expertise, the energy and environment sectors, validating our positive outlook for the market in the future. Moreover, they have been identified in geographies where we have a local presence, increasing our chance to be successful at the time of bidding. In the last month, we had kept increasing our sales force headcount. We focused on the organization from a macro regional one to country focusing in order not to lose a single opportunity and consolidate our commercial pricing in the regions that we are the targeting."

Yet these changes have not materially impacted, although there's been a very modest softening demand for North American frac services. Oil prices have rallied since early in the year, owing to an improved global economic outlook, ongoing OPEC+ voluntary production cuts and rising geopolitical tensions. Iranian oil exports are at multiyear highs with a nontrivial risk that future Iranian export volumes decline. Natural gas prices have conversely declined considerably since last fall, primarily owing to strong production and mild winter weather, both driving natural gas inventories to well above seasonal norms."

For 2017, with beef cost expectations remain muted, our outlook is for chicken demand to continue to be very solid as we believe the increase in total U.S. production across all protein complexes will be met with greater export demand as well as strong U.S. economic conditions, driving more protein consumption across the board and absorbing the supply. We will continue to refine our strategy and partnering with our key customers, broad customer and product mix and geographical footprint to better accelerate our growth potential in key categories above and beyond our presence in different bird sizes.

The flat-rolled market in North America appears to be very stable at this time and steel consumption in the U.S. market has bounced back quite well after the harsh winter weather finally subsided. The extreme weather conditions at the start of the year impacted numerous industry statists, such as steel production, service center shipment volumes and construction starts. Just getting the materials moved around the country proved to be an extraordinary task, which likely dampened the expectations as to the underlying strength of the economy. However, second quarter data points have suggested that the market here is consuming flat-rolled at a rate well above 2013 levels and has prompted both spot and contractual industries to keep buying steel to keep up with demand."

It's a bit too early to assess how much additional risk this could pose given the exposure of WEG, we're much more exposed to China than to the war issue. While there is a 0 COVID policy in China, the supply chain will always be influenced and there may be complications in times that could lead to scarcity of raw materials and increase in prices. So far, we have not felt that those consequences, but it doesn't mean that they could not come later. So we have to keep a close eye on that."

In totality, we are reasonably optimistic both the dry bulk and the product tanker market for the year. But let's first give you 4 examples how the uncertainties impact our markets. Trade wars will definitely be negative for the world economy, but it could be positive for both the dry bulk and the tanker market. We see if China buys soybeans from Brazil compared to the U.S., it increases the ton mile demand in the dry market. If U.S. buys oil products from Europe instead of Canada, increases ton mile demand for product tankers."

But at this point, the 1% to 3% price growth is not based on any sort of mix shift. Clearly, if volumes continue to recover in California as they appear to have or begin to stabilize and begin recovery, that will help on a mix. As we pointed out in the fourth quarter, our shipments in our markets in portions of North Carolina where we have operations were down substantially in North Carolina is a good state for us. We had much higher shipments in Texas, and the average selling price in Texas is significantly lower than it is in North Carolina, for example. So the recovery in North Carolina would help if that occurs in 2011. So there will always be some geographic mix differences, but the simple answer to your question is we have not projected any significant shifts in our pricing outlook for '11."

The average spread for bunker supply between the Port of Singapore, Rotterdam, Houston and Fujairah recently stood at about $150 per metric ton, and our scrubber vessels have benefited from the relatively lower high sulfur fuel oil prices versus the very low sulfur fuel oil pricing, which rose faster in response to the crude oil price increases."

I would say in Q4, in the year-ago period, if you remember, we had strong orders in North America. So Q4 will be again more North American focused. And so it's just the way it breaks down. I wouldn't read too much into quarter-to-quarter. But really just kind of looking at the year.

And so far as domestic orders are concerned, we saw 45% growth as compared to the quarter 1 of the previous year. INR 185 billion was the orders that we picked up from domestic markets in Q1 of the previous year. And in Q1 of the current year, we have picked up INR 267 billion. And much contrary to the expectation that the international order inflow would slow down consequent to the geopolitical crisis plus the tweets and retweets and the oil prices, we found that the international orders actually improved during the year-on-year period from INR 79 billion to INR 94 billion, which is a growth of 19% over the first quarter of the previous year."

Apio completed the transition from Nielsen Perishables FreshFacts data to the Nielsen Answers Data Platform last month, which will significantly improve the insights we gather to manage and drive innovation as well as pricing, promotional and merchandising decisions with our customers. Nielsen Answers provides many advantages over the previous system. Data collected from approximately twice the number of stores. We also now have access to store-specific product, pricing and promotional data and can break down the data among different banners, geographies and stores to enable Apio to build more effective pricing and promotional strategies."

We continue to monitor the situation daily as it remains a dynamic environment. And as Marillyn highlighted, we are proactively taking steps to help support our suppliers and teammates during this difficult time. Our current expectation is that the next few months will be the peak of disruption as the country and the rest of the world looks to successfully flatten the curve move forward. The Department of Defense and the United States government have also taken action to support our industry through policy changes and the Cares Act, and our outlook has taken into consideration these benefits. Together, these actions have allowed us to update the outlook we provided in January with minimal impacts."

Sales [ grew ] and yarn and fibre remain weak compared to downstream ready-made and retail segment. In spite of good footfall in retail segment, the market remained cautious and demand was not transferring into volumes wholesale yarn and fibre segment. Overall industry development across the globe and volatile geopolitical upheavals impacted the performance of textile markets. Both domestic and international markets have faced strong and chilly headwinds. The performance of Indian polyester industry has been rather challenging this year. The domestic market was flooded with cheaper imports of substandard polyester yarns and fibres."

And we don't really see anything beyond that happening in 2014. If anything the Army's come out committed to funding the Fort Rucker aviation training operating. So I don't think we have any kind of meaningful additional sales to try and risk that in 2014. And since we are at the topic of the Army, I want to provide some details so that you understand what our Army exposure risks so although we can talk about it today, the DoD comprised 68% of our sales in the 2013. And our guidance for 2014 contemplates the DoD will represent 65% sales for this year. The Army last year was 19% of sales and it's going down to 15% or 16% of sales in 2014. So I don't see a lot of downside to Army sales beyond 2014 and that's something that couple of folks asked about earlier in the call."
