Due to its high relevance in the development of the country, there was never any doubt about the need to take action to risk with PEMEX from the condition in which we found it. And for this reason, as we have been commenting in previous reports, PEMEX has had unprecedented support from the federal government to face the challenges involved in reversing the condition of the delegation in its performance and resuming a path of growth. The support mechanisms have been diverged from direct cash contribution and tax and regulatory benefits to agreements with other instances of the public administration to make our operation more efficient."

Brazil is interesting because, we after losing about 30% of its market last year, we thought that the region would kind of go through a soft lending with us some fairly meager, further erosion in 2015, however, considering the political crisis on top of the economic situation, the situation have turned for the worse. And we have seen significant meltdown in Q1, which obviously forces to revise estimate for the full year, and the way we see today, at the end of 2015, the demand for trucks may have decreased by 50% in the last couple of years."

And where vandalism was probably at the most during the beginning of the social unrest demonstrations, but it has fortunately subsided, number one, secondly, the -- all the banks were hit hard. It so happens that 1 of our banks, Banco de Occidente, as you mentioned, is headquartered in Cali. And as such, the headquarter building was also hit. The vandalism was perpetrated at the lobby level. And -- but that's all material damages, and it's all fortunately covered by insurance. Regarding the exposure of that bank to the                 1 has to remember that Banco do centers as the other banks of ours -- sorry, a national bank. And as such, it's exposure, its own exposure to the VA Kaka region is really not significant or materially larger than the exposure of all the other banks to the region. So the difference really of Banco de Occidente with the other banks is that its headquarter in Cali, but its exposure is not really that much bigger to the                 region. And as such, its portfolio will only be affected as much as the portfolio of all the other financial system banks to the ball Caca region. We expect -- we hope that will be the case."

And so it just becomes lumpy because it's a much smaller business. I think in Asia, we have a lot of work to do. I think we have a pretty small team there. I also think that we probably need to move to an in-country pricing model. Today, we have kind of worldwide pricing. And I think in markets like India, China, Pacific Rim, you probably need geographic specialized pricing just given how competitive those markets are. So Asia is our smallest revenue market today, but I think it represents one of the largest potentials for growth, and we're just going to need to put more focus on that market, quite frankly. And during the last year, it just wasn't a focus because of how small its revenue is.

Simply put, those institutions are under more pressure than ever to deliver better experiences for the employees and their citizens and to drive real productivity at a time of economic challenge. And the key thing is that they are now realizing the cloud is a great way to do this. And by and large, they largely overcome their security concerns around the cloud.

First of all, I'd like to specify tonight that we said we are going to produce the same amount of barrels in 2016 that is not a flat production. Why? Because in 2015, we had a one-off production coming as, as we said, from Iraq and Iranand 42,000 barrels per day. That means that this one-off will not be present next year or this year. So that is we are going to increase this year about 42,000 barrels per day because we are going to keep the same organically, so we'll keep the same production so that is an additional contribution. Then we have contingency. We have contingency and we have contingency for the full year plan. So we don't want now to disclose contingency today. But clearly, we have a good range of contingency to capture all the possible situations that we can face in the natural plant, geopolitical and others. So we are going first, and secondly, we have contingency that we are in a better positioned to disclose or describe it during the presentation in March."

And while we remain cautious about cyclical industries, the lingering effects of the pandemic and the war in Europe as well as the competitive state of the credit market, we believe we have built a very strong team and a solid sourcing and underwriting process. Further, the additional capital we raised late last year, the incremental contribution to the JV and the full effect of earnings from the deployments in Q4 provides a strong tailwind for our financial performance in Q1 of 2022 and the balance of 2022."

The year-on-year ADR decline was impacted by decreases in rates within several key markets such as the U.S., Japan and Hong Kong as well as an increased mix to faster-growing ADR markets. The increasing pressure on ADRs we're seeing in the second half of the year is influenced by lapping about a 1% growth in ADRs in the second half last year and by a number of macroeconomic-driven factors, including less travel in key international card oil due to trade and political issues as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar."

However, our actual first quarter year-over-year cost inflation rate was in the mid-teens. There have been several changes since our last earnings call that have resulted in a greater acceleration of inflationary cost pressure than we originally anticipated. First, the war in Ukraine has resulted in global cost inflation especially fuel prices and supply chain uncertainty; second, the COVID-related shutdowns in China have impacted the global supply chain by creating production issues and logistics challenges that could impact overseas parts and equipment availability for the foreseeable future; and third, we have seen an increase in overall inflation that has impacted the macroeconomic environment."

This is the second quarter in a row that our tax rate has been somewhat higher than the recent past. Tax rates, as you know, often fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to a variety of discrete items. More importantly, over the longer term, we have seen a modest increase in our average effective tax rate, primarily because of the changes in the geographic mix of where we generate income. Additionally, in 2014, we are being impacted by certain changes in tax laws including the delay in the renewal of the active financing exemption and the loss in the R&D tax credit. In the past, we've mentioned that we expected our effective tax rate to be in the low 30s range. When you look at the trend, we now believe that our rate for the full year could be closer to the mid-30s. As a last note on tax, I would point out that our tax rate in Q2 2013 was just 29.6%, which was unusually low and was driven by certain fixed discrete tax items, a challenge we will face in this year's second quarter while we'll be going over the impact of this lower rate."

And as we said through the script, Dianne, we're the only one of our competitors that have a nationwide footprint. And ultimately, that provides a very significant advantage of being able to address jobs in any market situation. And like we said, we think it positions us very well with the cost work that we've done and the experts that we have in the business to really thrive as this business comes back. Because this business has been generating $40 million to $46 million of gross profit from 2011 to 2015 -- 2014. In 2015, is really a cyclical down year that's not really out of the norm. If you look back at 2009 and 2010, you can see kind of that -- those cyclical swings. But at nationwide footprint is the thing that really helps us have an advantage of being able to attack any market across the country."

Germany and France are always on top of the list, and the reason being is I think Germany is very progressive in the way that they have approached the use of defibrotide in VOD. I think they're a good basis point for how we can look at a number of countries. One of the big differences between Germany and France is that while in Germany, it's central reimbursement. In France, it's actually hospital-based reimbursement. So they're not centrally paid for. So while I would characterize the 2 as being very different just from a reimbursement perspective, I'd also say that I'm pleased with the amount of use that we're seeing in France and the amount of physician support that we have for defibrotide in France is very good, too. So those are probably the 2 biggest countries and then you kind of look at the big 5 as being the majority of your support coming from."

Our noncompete agreement recently expired and we are getting inquiries about the prospects of reentering this market."
